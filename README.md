# My Personal Project

## Quiz Application


This **Quiz Application** will allow users to enter questions with corresponding answers and their level of difficulty
(*prompt*) into a quiz. Users will also be able to add or remove their prompts and view all the prompts in the quiz.
This quiz application can be used for people who want to test themselves on a certain topic or
memorize definitions by making quizzes. This project interests me because this application would be very useful in 
helping me test myself on terms/concepts taught in my classes.
