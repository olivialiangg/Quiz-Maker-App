# My Personal Project

## Quiz Application


This **Quiz Application** will allow users to enter questions with corresponding answers (*prompt*) into a quiz.
Users will then be able to test themselves by providing the correct answer to the given/displayed question. 
This quiz application can be used for those who want to test themselves on a certain topic or memorize definitions. 
This project interests me because this application would be very useful in helping me memorize/test myself 
on terms taught in my classes.
