# My Personal Project

## Quiz Application


This **Quiz Application** will allow users to enter questions with corresponding answers and their level of difficulty
(*prompt*) into a quiz. This quiz application can be used for those who want to test themselves on a certain topic or
memorize definitions. This project interests me because this application would be very useful in helping me 
memorize/test myself on terms taught in my classes.
