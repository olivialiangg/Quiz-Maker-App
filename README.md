## Quiz Maker Application


This **Quiz Maker Application** will allow users to make a quiz. Users can enter questions with corresponding answers 
and their level of difficulty (*prompt*) into a quiz. Users will also be able to add or remove any of their prompts 
from their quiz. All the questions and answer in the quiz can then be viewed. This quiz application can be used for 
people who want to make quizzes themselves or for others on a certain topic. This project interests me because this 
application would be very useful in helping me make test for myself on terms/concepts taught in my classes.
